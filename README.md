Files associated to video LTspice #24: Three Ways to Obtain the Loop Gain of a DC-DC Converter

Available at: https://youtu.be/9A7I9JdBG_w

In this video we present three ways to obtain the loop gain of a dc-dc converter by simulation. The theoretical analysis of a dc-dc converter to derive its loop gain is first reviewed. A WinPython script to plot the lopp gain of a dc-dc converter is presented. Finally, three ways to check the theoretical value of the loop gain are shown: i) by using the actual circuit, ii) by using the averaged circuit, and iii) by using the small-signal equivalent circuit.
